# EnviMo

Envimo is an app used for recording environmental monitoring data for the Philippines Wildlife Management Bureau of DENR. 
It is starting out for monitoring Marine Turtles by DENR rangers, but can be expanded later on for other animals or environmental factors.

Core features are:
- Support multiple different datasets depending on the user
- Allow offline recording, and sync reports when internet is available
- make use of the mobile GPS and camera for recording data
- Validate as much of the dataset upon recording to improve data quality.
